# Secret Sauce Size Chart Editor

Add, edit and view size charts of apparel brands with ease!

## Background

Size charts contain the measurements for each size label used by brands or designer for garments sold.
There are a large number of standard sizing systems around the world<sup>[1](#1)[2](#2)[3](#3)</sup>.

Sizing is quite inconsistent and there can be great differences in fit and measurement among brands.
Size charts can help navigate the landscape when shopping online.

## Concepts

Size charts (also called size guides) are provided by manufacturers for their brands and can apply to
one or more apparel categories. Separate size charts exist for women and men.
